        #For me, I do traffic collection on my gateway machine and analysis on another.  And I do traffic stats
        #collection using merely iptables, using rules spat out from the makeIptablesRules(interface) method.
        #This works very simply and requires no extra traffic statistics collection apps, just the ability to add
        #iptables rules (root access on the traffic collection machine).
        #In order to get access to the stats generated from iptables, I need to have root access on my gateway machine
        #accessible via this program, and yet if someone steals the SSH keys used by this program they should not be
        #able to do anything malicious.  I achieve this using the command= option in my authorized_keys file on the
        #host that I need to gain controlled root access to.  Using the command= option allows me to specify a string 
        #that is executed as a command when the user logs in with the private key corresponding to the appropriate entry
        #in the authorized_keys file.  I use this to tell it to run the string
        #  "iptables -v -Z -L TABLE"
        #Where TABLE is the name of the table that I need to check, and as you can see it must be done twice per
        #interface - once to check the IN direction and again to check the OUT direction.  Because I have two
        #internet connections, I have 4 lines below, two for each interface.  Note that of course independant keys
        #must be used per command for this method.
        #
        #The security-concious of you will notice that if anyone _does_ steal the keys, they _will_ be able to do
        #mildly malicious things, if you haven't properly secured your SSH server to logins from outside your network.
        #In this case, they may be able to skew your statistics by logging in and zeroing counters, but again this is
        #only if you let them by permitting root logins from non-trusted hosts.
