h1=. tcd (traffic control daemon)

=====================================================================
tcd is a traffic control daemon which uses live monitoring of 
traffic, combined with user specified rules for which protocols are
more important than others (voip over ssh, over gaming, over http 
and file transfers, etc.), and tweaks the settings of "tcng":http://tcng.sourceforge.net/ or "tc":http://linux.die.net/man/8/tc 
to guarantee the service levels desired, on the fly.
