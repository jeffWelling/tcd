h1=. tcd (traffic control daemon)

=====================================================================
tcd is a traffic control daemon which uses live monitoring of 
traffic, combined with user specified rules for which protocols are
more important than others (voip over ssh, over gaming, over http 
and file transfers, etc.), and tweaks the settings of "tcng":http://tcng.sourceforge.net/ or "tc":http://linux.die.net/man/8/tc 
to guarantee the service levels desired, on the fly.


h4. Current Capabilities

Currently, tcd collects statistics and stores them to keep track of and report back 
to the user how much bandwidth has been used within their billing cycle.  
Configuration of tcd is done via profiles, which are located in the 
lib/tcd/profiles/ directory.  There should be an example profile in that directory.


h4. Configuration (Profiles)

A profile consists of a couple of methods,

@module TCD@
@  module Profiles@
@    module Gir@
@      class << self@
@        useProfile()@
@        getStats()@
@        rolloverDay()@
@      end@
@    end@
@  end@
@end@

**useProfile()** must return true if this profile should be polled on the next 
iteration of the main() loop.

**getStats()** must return a hash in the form of

@{ :INTERFACE_NAME => {:in=>x,:out=>y}}@

where INTERFACE_NAME is a symbol of the name of the interface, and x and y are 
the number of received and transmitted bytes respectively, as intergers.  
Executing getStats() must reset the counters - that is, if only one byte has 
been sent and received since the last time getStats() was called, x and y 
should both equal 1.  Not 1, plus however many bytes had traversed previously. 

There are a couple of ways you can go about writing your getStats() method to 
retrieve the information, more can be found below, and in the example in 
lib/tcd/profiles/.

**rolloverDay()** must return a hash such as

@{ :INTERFACE => DAY }@

where INTERFACE is an interface in that profile, and DAY is the first day of your
billing cycle to count bandwidth from.  Day must be an interger, not a string.
For example, if the interface name is eth0, and the first day of your biling cycle
is the 11th, then it would look like

@{ :eth0 => 11,@
@  :INTERFACE => DAY}@

There we also have an example of multiple interfaces, simply add another element to 
the hash.


h4. Configuration (Ways of **getStats()**-ing)

Currently, I use a fairly simple, and to the best of my investigating fairly secure setup
where I created two new ssh keys in the tcd directory, both without passphrases.  One for
the in traffic and one for the out traffic.  Then, I copied the keys to my gateway
machine and appended them to my authorized_keys file, but before logging out, I edited
the lines that I'd just added to the authorized_keys file.  Where the lines began as

@ssh-rsa AAAAB3N...=@
@ssh-rsa AAAAB3N...=@

I changed them to

@command="/usr/bin/pmacct -s -e -p /tmp/pmacct_eth2_tcd_in.pipe" ssh-rsa AAAAB3N...=@
@command="/usr/bin/pmacct -s -e -p /tmp/pmacct_eth2_tcd_out.pipe" ssh-rsa AAAAB3N...=@

OK now lets point out some things.  This tells ssh that logging in with that key means
that the user is allowed to login, to recieve the output of command="" executing, and
then log out again. And nothing else.  Don't take my word for it, try it for yourself.
If you want to be even more secure you can use from= to only allow logins from specific
hosts.

Now, I use pmacct on my gateway to collect traffic statistics, and you can see in the
example above, I'm executing pmacct on 2 different pipes, for in and out respectively.
How you collect and get these statistics into the **getStats()** method's output is
left entirely up to you so you can use any method you wish.  If, however, you want to
mimic my setup, then install pmacct on your gateway and try out this example config.
I extracted the important lines from my own config; I'd post my config itself but it
has several plugins configured and may be overcomplicated for the average user.

__/etc/pmacct/pmacctd.eth2.conf__

@daemonize: true@
@pidfile: /var/run/pmacctd.pid@
@syslog: daemon@
@interface: eth2@
@plugins: memory[tcd_in], memory[tcd_out]@
@aggregate[tcd_in]: dst_host@
@aggregate[tcd_out]: src_host@
@aggregate_filter[tcd_in]: dst host 1.2.3.4@
@aggregate_filter[tcd_out]: src host 1.2.3.4@
@imt_path[tcd_in]: /tmp/pmacct_eth2_tcd_in.pipe@
@imt_path[tcd_out]: /tmp/pmacct_eth2_tcd_out.pipe@

First of all, notice that the interface I'm monitoring is eth2, and the filename 
is **/etc/pmacct/pmacctd.__eth2__.conf**.  
Pmacct will look for /etc/pmacct/pmacctd.INTERFACE.conf where INTERFACE is each 
interface.  Also note the imt_path directives, those are the pipe locations that 
you need to use in the authorized_keys file's command= call.  For more information
on pmacct configurations, Google is your friend.



After you've decided on a way of collecting statistics (or implemented pmacct and 
the examples above) it's time to pull the code;

@git clone git://github.com/jeffWelling/tcd.git@

in a working directory of your choice.
Then, 

@cd tcd@

or whatever you chose to override the directory name with, if you did.
Before being able to check any statistics, you are going to need to create a 
profile which is outlined above in **Configuration**.  After creating a profile,
you can run

@bin/tcd_collector start@

and that should start the tcd_collector daemon.  This will create log files 
in ~/.tcd/stats for statistics collection and to calculate the total bandwidth 
used in a billing period.
